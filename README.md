1) Clone the project
2) npm install
3) tns run android
4) Once the app is successfully installed & opened on Android device, Tap on "OPEN ACTIVITY FROM AAR" button.
5) The app will crash saying NoClassDefError for "MainBindings"

I don't know why MainBindings.java which is supposed to be generated by "DataBinding" is not being generated in NativeScript project.

If I use the same databinding-debug.aar file from /plugin/platform/android in Native Android app in AndroidStudio, Everything works.
